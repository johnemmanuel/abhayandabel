                                By giving Senate and Assembly the chance to debate together, the Saturday committee
                                sessions could be much more engaging. It would also allow delegates to talk to people
                                outside of their own committee as well.

                                As of right now successfull bills must attain a high bucketing score, pass in their
                                committee of origin, pass in the opposite commitee, and be approved by the Cabinet
                                before they are passed. Such a monumental deserves more recognition on the YAG
                                website and the YAG instagram account.

                                Many returning delegates know how a low bucketing score for your bill can prevent your
                                bill from being heard at all. This can ruin your entire conference, but there is a
                                solution.
                                By allowing bill merging during conference, delegates with low bucketing scores could
                                team up
                                with each other so they can at least present a form of their bill at conference.

                            <p>
                                Every year, at least one of the gubernatorial candidates will bring up the need for
                                better Wifi at conference. But the very paper oriented nature of conference has
                                prevented this from happening. By using our experience this year, in an entirely virtual
                                format, we can modernize YAG completely so that better wifi becomes a critical part of
                                conference.
                            </p>
                        </li>

                            <p>
                                The second part of modernizing YAG is setting up a website or an app to guide delegates
                                during conference. Such a site would include a updated docketing system, a map and
                                personal schedule of the conference , and a place to vote in elections. A better
                                docketing system could tell you what stage in the approval process your bill is in, and
                                upcoming bills could also be viewed ahead of time. The personalized map and schedule
                                would tell you everything you need to know to be ready for each committee session. And
                                with voting also taking place virtually, we could eliminate bill binders, conference
                                folders, and paper ballots.

                                Despite being sister programs, MUN and YAG often do little to help each other grow.
                                By making it easier for existing MUN delegations to join YAG, conference could
                                easily gain hundreds of delegates. More delegates allows for more committees and
                                a greater diversity of delegates from all over the state.

                            <p>
                                The greatest challenge to increasing the size of conference is that every increase
                                has to be done by creating a delegation at a new school. Simply allowing delegates
                                to attend independently is done through various YMCAs but such an option is not
                                advertised anywhere. It is also limited to a select few delegates and is not open
                                to many. By expanding this independent entry into the program, students from schools
                                without YAG delegations can still enjoy conference. And given time, some of these
                                students could start their own delegations and the program would continue to grow.
