                                solution. By allowing bill merging during conference, delegates with low bucketing
                                scores could
                                team up with each other so they can at least present a form of their bill at conference.

                                Every year, at least one of the gubernatorial candidates will bring up the need for
                                better Wifi at conference. But the very paper oriented nature of conference has
                                prevented this from happening. By using our experience this year, in an entirely virtual
                                format, we can modernize YAG completely so that better wifi becomes a critical part of
                                conference.

                                The second part of modernizing YAG is setting up a website or an app to guide delegates
                                during conference. Such a site would include a updated docketing system, a map and
                                personal schedule of the conference , and a place to vote in elections. A better
                                docketing system could tell you what stage in the approval process your bill is in, and
                                upcoming bills could also be viewed ahead of time. The personalized map and schedule
                                would tell you everything you need to know to be ready for each committee session. And
                                with voting also taking place virtually, we could eliminate bill binders, conference
                                folders, and paper ballots.

                                The greatest challenge to increasing the size of conference is that every increase
                                has to be done by creating a delegation at a new school. Simply allowing delegates
                                to attend independently is done through various YMCAs but such an option is not
                                advertised anywhere. It is also limited to a select few delegates and is not open
                                to many. By expanding this independent entry into the program, students from schools
                                without YAG delegations can still enjoy conference. And given time, some of these
                                students could start their own delegations and the program would continue to grow.

                        Iâ€™m a junior from Montgomery High School.
                        This is my second year as a YAG officer and first year as a board member for the Montgomery YAG
                        delegation.

                        Iâ€™m a huge Star Wars and Marvel nerd which is why I always play classic rock from
                        Guardians of the Galaxy at the start of committee sessions. Be
